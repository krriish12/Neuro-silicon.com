This repository holds a small static React site for training and internships in Data Science and VLSI Engineering.

Local development
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app uses Vite + React and Bootstrap for styling. I'll continue by implementing routing and individual pages next.
